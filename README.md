# Investigation-on-Neural-Network-for-RSSI-based-localization
A neural network model is used for investigation of localization accuracy  
The concept of neural network is used for indoor localization, In our previous work a embedded and Machine learning approaches we have studied, this work is the extension of the previous work in order to obtained a better performance of the model, so Matlab is used to train the neural network model when we have investigated a different algorithm for training and testing  which describe below, We have trained the model on 10 hidden neurons with 4x768 input and 2x768 output matrix.
 

## 1. Training 
These are presented to the network during training, and the network is adjusted according to its error.
## 2. Validation
These are used to measure network generalization, and to halt training when generalization stops improving.
## 3. Testing 
These have no effect on training and so provide an independent measure of network performance during and after training.
